# @kozimo/blockz-scss

This package contains the SCSS components of Blockz Design System.

## Installation

The package can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm i @kozimo/blockz-scss --save
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add @kozimo/blockz-scss
```

## Usage

You can import Blockz styles in JavaScript with this import:

```js
import '@kozimo/blockz-scss/dist/styles.css';
```

That syntax is Webpack specific (and will work with Create React App), but you can use Blockz anywhere that supports ES6 module bundling and global CSS.
